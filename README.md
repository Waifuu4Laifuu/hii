The repository for your Unity Game Task assessment
</br>
</br>
<b>Important notes:</b>
</br></br>
Save, Commit and Push your assignment repository regularly. Failure to resolve upload issues will not be accepted as a valid excuse for non-submission by the due date.
</br></br>
Make sure you build your game/assignment in a single scene using the included 'main' in the Scenes folder. The first time you open the project it may default to a new/untitled scene - be sure to always open your 'main' first and work in that.
</br></br>
Any assets that you create for your assignment (e.g. prefabs, materials, animations, etc.) should be stored in the "My Assets" folder located at ".../Assets/My Assets" to differentiate them from any third-party or supplied assets.
</br></br>
Breaching this rule, by placing third-party assets within the "My Assets" folder will be seen as a breach of Academic Integrity (plagiarism).
You should create a proper file hierarchy within your "My Assets" folder (e.g. Animations, Materials, Prefabs, etc.).
There is a MS Word file named "Unity Game Task_Marks_Claimed_Template.docx" in the Assets folder. Use this as the starting point for your report, and continue to save and edit it in this location. This report includes a checklist of implemented features. Features not documented in this report will not be marked.
</br></br>
Only after you have made your final commit and push, and are ready to submit your assignment.
</br></br>
